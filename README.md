# Workstation Setup

This project automates the process of setting up a new Pivotal Labs machine using a simple [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script.

## Getting Started

**Warning: the automation script is currently aggressive about what it does and will overwrite vim configurations, bash-it configurations, etc.**

- Update to [El Capitan](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1018109117)
- Install [Xcode 7](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)

Then open up the OS X Terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
$ cd workspace
$ git clone https://github.com/pivotal/workstation-setup.git
$ cd workstation-setup
$ ./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Having problems?

## What about sprout-wrap?

This project is pr   ovided as an alternative to the [pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap](https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap) project. You are encouraged to use that project if it better suits your needs.

The goals of this projects is to keep the setup process simple and up to date:
